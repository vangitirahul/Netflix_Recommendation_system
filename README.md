# Netflix Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a recommendation system for Netflix content, including movies and TV shows. The system utilizes the Netflix dataset to provide personalized content recommendations to users based on their viewing history and preferences.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Netflix Movies and TV Shows" dataset, which includes details such as title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, and genres.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features that could improve the recommendation quality, such as extracting genres and creating user profiles.

### Model Selection

Several machine learning models were explored for the recommendation system:

- Collaborative Filtering
- Content-Based Filtering
- Hybrid Models combining the strengths of both approaches

### Model Training and Evaluation

- The models were trained using a subset of the dataset.
- Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess the performance of the models.

## Results
